/*
Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

    record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
    total(): returns the total number of hits recorded
    range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?
